 Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for detecting forest fires using image data. The system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on relevant datasets to classify images as either fire or non-fire.

 Features
- Uses deep learning models for accurate fire detection
- Trained on image datasets for classification
- Implemented in Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation
- Can be further extended for real-time fire detection

 Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fire-detection-main.git
   cd fire-detection-main
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the `Forest_fire_detection_using_DL.ipynb` file to train and test the model.

 Usage
- Load the dataset and preprocess images
- Train the deep learning model
- Test the model using sample images
- Evaluate performance and visualize results

 Future Enhancements
- Implement real-time fire detection using a webcam
- Deploy the model as a web service using Flask
- Improve accuracy with more training data and hyperparameter tuning
